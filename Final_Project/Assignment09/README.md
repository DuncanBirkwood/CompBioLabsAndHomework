## The Effect of Different Species Characteristics on Local Extinction in Kalamazoo County

### Biological Question
Are species characteristics such as community association, native status, growth form, life history, and rarity able to explain local species loss at the county level?

### Context
Due to human activity, many species are under threat of extinction. Currently, it is very difficult to predict the risk of extinction for many threatened species.  Species characteristics are useful in predicting the response to human-driven change and may also help predict the likelihood of extinction. Historical data on species losses can help to identify specific traits that influence threatened species to local extinction.  This study intends to answer its biological question by utilizing historical data gathered in Kalamazoo County.
### Methods
##### Data Source
The data used in this study was provided in an Excel spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet contains 1137 rows all of which correspond to unique species groups in various different environments.  The spreadsheet also contains 15 different columns which correspond to 15 different categories of species characteristics.  The species characteristics that I personally analyzed were community association, native status, growth form, life history, and rarity.  The size of that data in the file is 122.7 Kb.

The data was collected in Kalamazoo County, Michigan, USA which covers approximately 1492 square kilometers.  This county was first surveyed for botanical data from the 1890s to the 1940s and then was resurveyed in the 1990s.  The later survey expanded on the previous survey and even added 133 new species.  The data was collected through surveying sites across the county, taking detailed notes, collecting plant samples, and compiling the data collected into a document that recorded various different species characteristic for each species.

The researchers who carried out this study drew upon and combined both data sets.  The researchers then assigned a value of 0 (locally extinct) or 1 (non-extinct).  To do this they analyzed data from both surveys and looked at species that were described in the first survey, but were no longer found in the later survey to determine their status as extinct.  This extinction data was then cross referenced with herbarium records to confirm their extinction status.  This extinction status value was then combined with the data of each species from the earlier survey to create the modern Excel spreadsheet that was used in the final project calculations.
##### How the Original Authors Utilized this Data
With the data gathered the researchers created a variety of statistical models to illustrate which species characteristics had the biggest influence on local extinction.  The researchers utilized bar plots, box plots, and linear graphs to show the various different factors that could affect local extinction.  Each of their statistical figures that they produced created a plot with proportion of species extinct on the y-axis which allows for conclusions to be drawn pertaining to the species characteristics that correspond to the highest incidence of extinction.  Through these visual and statistical tests the authors were able to determine that prairie species, edge species, regionally rare species, and habitat specialists were the species characteristics with the highest likelihood of leading to local extinction.
##### How I personally Utilized the Data
My goal for this project was to create some type of visual that would illustrate to the viewer which species characteristics coincide with higher rates of local extinction.  In order to achieve this, I created a bar plot visual using the package ggplot2 that would illustrate a variety of species characteristics and the percent of species for each species characteristic that became locally extinct.  The species characteristics analyzed under my personal analysis were community association, native status, growth form, life history, and rarity.  For each unique species characteristic, I created one specific bar plot to display the data.  Following the creation of 5 separate bar plots for the 5 different species characteristics I merged each of these plots onto one plot grid through the “cowplots” package.  This created a one page visual that contained 5 different plots corresponding to the 5 analyzed species characteristics.  The percent of species locally extinct was displayed on each of these bar plots in order to draw conclusions about which species characteristics have the greatest effects on local extinction.
### Results and Conclusion
From the visual analyses I produced in R, I found that for the species characteristic category named community, species living in prairie communities had the highest percent of extinction.  For the species characteristic category named rarity, rare species had the highest percent of extinction.  For the species characteristic category named growth form, forb had the highest percent of extinction.  For the species characteristic category named life history, annual/perennial had the highest percent of extinction.  And lastly, for the species characteristic category named native status, native species had the highest percent of extinction.  This supports the idea that species characteristics can help to explain local extinction at the county level because the species characteristics prairie, rare, forb, annual/perennial, and native all corresponded with higher percentages of extinction among the species surveyed.

This figure is a visualization of the percentages of extinction for each unique species characteristics.  The horizontally aligned x-axis labels define the species characteristic category and the vertically aligned x-axis labels define the specific species characteristics under each category.  The red coloration represents the percentage of species that have gone locally extinct for the given species characteristics and the blue coloration represents the percentage of species that are currently alive for the given species characteristic.
