This repo contains my work and works in progress for the class EBIO 4420 (meaning Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 4420) at the University of Colorado Boulder.  This class is a computational biology class taught by Professor Sam Flaxman and acts as an introduction to computing for upper division students in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the Univeristy of Colorado Boulder.
