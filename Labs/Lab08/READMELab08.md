### Description of Lab08

##### Model Used
This code utilizes the discrete-time logistic growth model.  This model predicts the population abundance at each generation given a set of numerical conditions relating to the population.

##### Description of Code
The code uses this discrete-time logistic growth model and expands upon it.  The function() command was utilized to create a function that inputs the variables r (intrinsic growth rate), k (carrying capacity), g (total number of generations), and p (initial population size).  This function then outputs and plots the generation and population abundance at each generation of logistic growth.  

Following the creation of the function the data set is written to a file named "LogGrowth.csv" with the first column "generations" and the second column "abundance."
