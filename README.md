# Computational Biology - EBIO 4420 - Duncan Birkwood's Repository

## Overall Description:
This repo contains my work and works in progress for the class EBIO 4420 (meaning Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 4420) at the University of Colorado Boulder.  This class is a computational biology class taught by Professor Sam Flaxman and acts as an introduction to computing for upper division students in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado Boulder.  

#### CompBioLabsAndHomework Folder:

This folder contains a progression of increasing complexity of code for labs 1-8.  These labs involve data manipulation, pushing plain-text files, vectoring and structuring data, graphing, if-then statements, function creating in R, and markdown file manipulation.
